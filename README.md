# spanishpeaks-com

Development repository for Spanish Peaks WordPress development.

*Find build notes and commands in* `BUILDFILE.md`

## Development Environment
Uses [Fabrica Dev Kit](https://github.com/yeswework/fabrica-dev-kit/) as basis for setting up build pipeline, server(s) using Docker, Twig templating, browser testing (via Browsersync), version control for [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) (using ACF-JSON), and deployments (using WordMove) 

## Features 
We don't use everything that FDK makes available, but some of the key things that we're using.
